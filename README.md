# Data Visualization with SAS

This repository is summarized through the readme. All of the plots were created using SAS Studio code. See full data source references at the bottom of the readme.

## Small Business Analysis Data 
A mock data set created by myself is used for the bubble plot demo. This is a data set with details about a small clothing resale business. 

### Bubble Plots 
#### First is a bubble plot of profit vs. sales for all clothing types by clothing niche (luxury, trendy, and vintage).
